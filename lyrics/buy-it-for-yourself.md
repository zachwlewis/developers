Buy It For Yourself
===

Everything you know is wrong  
Nobody is waiting for you  
Praying that one day you  
Might have someone to hold  

And the snow starts falling  
And the holiday's crawling toward you  
Nobody's gonna' know if you get yourself  
The very best gift that no one will give to you  

So go online  
Make a wishlist, don't tell anyone  
They say love is blind,  
But you know that you love you,
And what to do.  

Buy the shit you want  
Say it's a gift  
When it comes you don't have to wait for Christmas.  
Just tear into it.

No ones gonna' tell you no.  
No one's gonna' say don't peek.  
When you buy the gifts you want for yourself  
You don't have to wait all week.  

Buy the gifts you want.  
Buy the gifts you need.  
Don't let anyone tell you it's wrong  
'cause you got no one to need.

Tell me how to love  
When no one's buying gifts for me.  
All I want is someone to hold  
When the snow falls down on me  

Buy the gits I want.  
Say they're from you.  
I would wrap them up,  
But that's a little sad to do.  

Even worse than what I've done.  
Even worse than what I need.  
When you buy gifts for yourself,  
Christmas is too sad, you see.  

Under the tree  
It's a big blank space.  
Put your gifts down there  
And throw your heart away.  

You know that love  
Won't fit down your chimney.  
You,  
You just buy what you want.  

Love won't come if you don't look.  
That's a pain to do.  
Around the holidays,  
Everybody has already bundled up with the ones they love.  
They've cuddled up and snuck away.  

Buy the gifts you want.  
Buy them for yourself.  
You don't have to wait days and days.
