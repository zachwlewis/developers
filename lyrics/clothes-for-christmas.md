Clothes For Christmas
=====================

Wake up at the crack of dawn.  
There's a layer of snow on the ground.  
Put a pot of cheap coffee on,  
And wake you up without a sound.

We all gather round the tree,  
It's Christmas time again.  
You scream "Open this one first!"  
I shake it and listen in.

There's no rattle, there's a faint crunch,  
Of tissue paper wrapped tight.  
The look upon my face says,  
"It's gonna' be an unholy night"

Cuz, all I got was clothes for Christmas,  
The best gift possible.  
All I got was clothes for Christmas,  
It's the worst day of the year.

And after the damage is done,  
There's cardigans scattered around.  
How am I supposed to have any fun,  
With these clothes lying cold on the ground.

Yeah, you could say I wanted more,  
Than itchy wool on my chest.  
All my friends got PS4s,  
Yeah, their moms, their moms are all the best.

But, all I got was clothes for Christmas,  
It's the worst day of the year.  
And all I got was clothes for Christmas,  
How the hell am I supposed to have any Christmas cheer at all?

None at all.  
None at all.  
None at all.  
Last year was great, oh how far you have fallen.

When, all I got was clothes for Christmas,  
The worst thing to have happened yet.  
Even the dog got clothes for Christmas,  
Not a single toy for the pet.  

Well!  
Clothes!  
Noes!  
Ho ho ho no ho no!  

All I got was clothes for Christmas,  
On the best day of the year.  
All I got was clothes for Christmas with the tags still on,  
Now I know St. Nick ain't real.
