Kids
====

You were crying out your eyes on the keyboard  
You know it's real.

How could they,  
Oh, how could they  
Say those things to you?

You thought they were your friends,  
You thought it was the end  
Of the world you knew.

Look up.  
Look up at the stars.  
They shine tonight.

And you know,  
And you know,  
Everything's alright.

Oh the kids can be mean,  
Oh the kids can be cruel,  
But you are strong.

Oh the kids can be mean,  
The kids can be cruel,  
But you are strong.

Stronger than I ever was.

You say that it's not enough  
That they just go away,  
And that they hide their faces during the day,  
Because you know they're coming back tonight.  
They're out for blood.

So you scream  
And you hide your face.

So run,  
So run away.  
Don't leave a trace.

But the kids can be cruel,  
The kids can be mean,  
But they're just kids.

They're still growing up,  
They're going through stuff  
That you did.

Oh the kids can be cruel,  
The kids can be mean,  
The kids can be you.

But I know you're stong.

You'll get through.  
You'll get through.
