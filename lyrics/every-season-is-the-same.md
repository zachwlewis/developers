Every Season Is The Same
========================

With the snow falling, falling down,
Covering the town in whites and greys and blues,
All I think about is you.
All I think about is you.

The bells are ringing loud across the town
And I see your face!
The bells are peeling out, ringing loud,
Where's your face?

Another Christmas day will come my way,
And afterwards I know you'll be gone.

Another Christmas day will come and pass,
And afterwards, I'll be left in the cold.

All the good and bad, the happy and the sad,
Collide, arrive, it was you!

Another happy seasons with my family,
Only wish my family was you.

Every season is the same.
Every season is the same and I wish things could change.

Another winter dream will pass.
