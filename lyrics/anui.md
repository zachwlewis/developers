Can you remember  
The last time you were held?

I can.

I can still feel your warmth  
On my mouth.

I want you to know  
You made me what I am.

Is the day faded  
And drownded in your eyes?

Or is it still fresh,  
As you remember how I was?

I remember when  
We undressed each other by the fire.

We told each other  
Everything, everything.  

How could you  
Not remember?

You had excuses stacked like books  
Underneath that December.

Are your fantasies aligned  
With the lines you spoke?  
Are your dreams intact?  
Or will they haunt you   
When you're so very old.

The harder we know  
The harder we forget,  
That it's not what you're dreaming,  
But who you dream it with.

Was I the best man that you know?  
I know this world is for  
No matter how it came  
You gave it away.
